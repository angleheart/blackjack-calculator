# blackjack-calculator

A calculator designed to calculate the house edge on a game of blackjack with respect to variations in house rules, betting strategies, and card counting.

This project is a work in progress.

BlackJack is a game that is beatable, if you implement the right strategies. Calculations can be done to solve for the exact
house edge- however, with so many different variables at play running a simulation may be the best result.

The purpose of this project is to allow the flexibility to configure the exact table rules, and even code your own players
that implement any strategy you wish and see the results. Tables can support multiple or single players. Single deck, double deck,
shoe, CSM can all be used. Simple variations to rules can easily be added.

A lot of the base code has been implemented, the actual running of the table is what needs to be completed.
